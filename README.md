AWM Sniping Bot Setup Guide for Kali Linux
1. System Update & Essentials
Before starting, ensure your Kali Linux system is up-to-date to avoid any issues with packages or
tools:
Command to update your system:
sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y
2. Programming Languages & Dependencies
For this project, Python is the main language along with a few libraries for automation and computer
vision.
Install Python and Pip:
sudo apt install python3 python3-pip -y
Install necessary Python packages:
pip3 install opencv-python pyautogui pynput mss ultralytics
These libraries are essential for:
- OpenCV: Image processing and target detection.
- PyAutoGUI and Pynput: Mouse and keyboard automation.
- MSS: Fast multi-screen capture.
- YOLO: Object detection models (Ultralytics).
3. Game Memory Interaction Tools
For low-level memory manipulation and reverse engineering, you need tools to inspect the game's
memory and gather useful offsets.Install Cheat Engine:
sudo apt install cheatengine -y
For reverse engineering:
sudo apt install ghidra -y
These tools will help in finding the exact memory addresses for players, targets, and other
game-specific data.
4. Automation & Scripting
To script your bot, you'll need automation tools like PyAutoGUI and Pynput for simulating mouse
clicks and movements.
Install Xautomation (alternative for Linux):
sudo apt install xautomation -y
To capture game windows or screen regions:
sudo apt install scrot -y
5. Testing & Debugging Tools
To debug and test your bot in a sandbox environment:
sudo apt install sandboxie -y
For virtual environments:
sudo apt install virtualbox -y
This allows you to safely test your bot without affecting your main system.
